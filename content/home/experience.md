  AWS re/Start is a training and job placement programme to educate young adults on the latest software development and cloud computing technologies.
  * Deployed a serverless website (www.roshbeed.com). I used CloudFront, Route 53 and S3 to serve the static assets. I created a microservice using Lambda, DynamoDB and API Gateway to allow users to post and view comments. I used CodePipeline to build the static Jekyll site by processing files from CodeCommit and producing artefacts in S3. I reduced the build time from 3 minutes to 30 seconds by building a custom build environment with pre-packaged dependencies.
  * Adopted extracurricular activities (like attending meetups about DevOps and Agile) to proactively learn new skills, beyond the scope of the programme.
  * Technical skill lessons: AWS, Linux, Networking, Security, Databases, Programming (Python)
  * Cloud Concept lessons: Economics (TCO, CapEx/OpEx), Infrastructure as Code, Configuration Management, Serverless
