  Using the power of ingenuity to build a positive human future in a technology-driven world with a global network of FTSE 100 and Fortune 500 clients.
  * Deployed a three-tier CMS to AWS using Terraform with CodePipeline for CI/CD. I created the continuous deployment pipeline which allowed us to provision infrastructure by pushing files to CodeCommit.
  * Because of Covid-19 there was a lack of project work. I used the extra time to my advantage: I spent off-the-clock time self-learning and studying for cloud certifications (12xAWS, 8xGCP, 2xAzure, 2xCKA*, 2xHashiCorp) and sharing what I learnt with the rest of the company.
  * Created a new internal training scheme to teach AWS skills to PA people and help them pass AWS certifications.
  * Advocated the use of AWS and found participants for an internal AWS GameDay. A simulated day of deploying services and responding to cyber-attacks.

  AWS re/Start is a training and job placement programme to educate young adults on the latest software development and cloud computing technologies.
  * Deployed a serverless website (www.roshbeed.com). I used CloudFront, Route 53 and S3 to serve the static assets. I created a microservice using Lambda, DynamoDB and API Gateway to allow users to post and view comments. I used CodePipeline to build the static site by processing files from CodeCommit and producing artefacts in S3. I reduced the build time from 3 minutes to 30 seconds with a custom build environment with pre-packaged dependencies

  Increased performance of services with new technologies. Configured, tested and deployed updates to services for the UK public sector.
  * Reduced the time of a weekly manual task of copying data from a CSV into a GUI from 2 days to 2 hours with a python script.
  * Created a simple yet secure multi-user secrets management system using GPG for encryption-at-rest and Git over SSH for encryption-in-transit. Used CodeCommit to synchronise passwords between users.
  * Reduced the speed of Alfresco deployments from hours to minutes by creating a golden AMI using Ansible.
