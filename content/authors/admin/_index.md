I’m a life-long learner, I have a deep passion for understanding how things work and curious about new ideas and technology. I create innovative yet simple solutions to complex problems and support customers throughout their journey into the cloud. I am a driven, self-starter, confident in communicating with technical and business leaders from startups to global brands.

My passion for technology started as a child by disassembling devices like the family computer. This passion for understanding how things work developed into a love of learning which led me to study Computer Science at university.

On the AWS re/Start programme, my favourite topics were Programming and Networking. Motivated by my passion for technology, I created a website to share articles on Linux (www.roshbeed.com). During the programme, I learnt I could improve my website by migrating it to the cloud. I faced challenges using services not covered in the programme which I overcame by reading the documentation and asking for help. I adopted extracurricular activities (attending meetups of DevOps and Agile methodologies) to proactively learn new skills, beyond the scope of the programme.

I am early in my career. I am learning about the industry as I continue to develop my business and technical skills. I do this to satisfy my love of learning whilst increasing the solutions I can deliver to customers.
