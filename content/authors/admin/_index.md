I have over five years of experience across architecture, engineering and development. I am looking for customer-facing roles in Solutions Architecture.

I am a life-long learner. I have a deep passion for understanding how things work and curious about new ideas and technology. I create innovative yet simple solutions to complex problems and support customers throughout their journey into the cloud. I am confident in building relationships with technical and business leaders from startups to global brands.

My passion for technology started as a child by disassembling devices like the family computer. This passion for understanding how things work developed into a love of learning which led me to study Computer Science at university.

I was excited to be one of the first students accepted into Amazon’s full-time, classroom-based development and training program AWS re/Start. I was supported by professional mentors and accredited trainers where I completed cloud training featuring scenario-based learning, hands-on labs, and coursework. I adopted extracurricular activities (attending DevOps/Agile meetups) to proactively learn new skills beyond the scope of the program.

After completing the AWS re/Start program I joined PA Consulting, a premier AWS consulting partner. My main responsibilities are designing cloud-native architectures for POCs, implementing DevOps CI/CD pipelines and working with healthcare and public sector clients. I am committed to diversity and inclusion within PA by volunteering as a mentor in the Women in Tech mentorship scheme.

I am learning about the industry as I continue to develop my business and technical skills. I do this to satisfy my love of learning whilst increasing the solutions I can deliver to customers. I am searching for solutions architect roles where I can use my creativity to educate customers about new cloud technologies.

- AWS re/Start Graduate – one of the first accepted to AWS’ highly regarded and competitive training program
- Currently working for an AWS Advanced Consulting Partner, Automation Logic
- Experience delivering from POC and Pilot, to Production scale deployments in public and private orgs
- Holder of 28 active cloud certifications across various platforms and technologies
- Regular attendee of local community events like DevOps/Agile meetups
- Confident in customer-facing dialogue and public speaking
- Active social presence and regular content creator in the cloud arena
- Mentor in a Women in Tech mentorship scheme
- Mentored by a tenured Senior Solutions Architect at AWS
