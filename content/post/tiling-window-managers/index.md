## List vs. Tree
Stacking window managers utilise lists to draw windows in order. List-based tiling window managers use them to populate a predefined grid layout.

Tree-based tiling window managers can have different layouts at each parent node. You can define horizontal or vertical splits and place windows wherever you wish.

## Stacking Window Managers
The windows act like pieces of paper on a desk. They can be drawn anywhere on the screen. They can overlap.

## Tiling Window Managers
Tiling window managers place windows in a grid where none of the windows can overlap.

Here we have two windows horizontally split.

Two horizontal splits can achieve the same layout.

## Conclusion
Tiling window managers offer us a fast and efficient way to organise windows. Tree-based tiling window managers enable us to create custom layouts on-the-fly.

Learning to master a tiling window manager is daunting. It requires a paradigm shift in your window management mindset. Your optimal keybindings may take countless iterations to perfect.

Tiling window managers allow us to manage windows solely through the keyboard. Slowing down our workflow to use the mouse to organise windows is a thing of the past. Start using a tiling window manager today!
