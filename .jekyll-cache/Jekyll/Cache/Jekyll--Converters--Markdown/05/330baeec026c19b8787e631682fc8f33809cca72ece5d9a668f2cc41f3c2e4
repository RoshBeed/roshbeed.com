  <li>Deployed a serverless website (www.roshbeed.com). I used CloudFront, Route 53 and S3 to serve the static assets. I created a microservice using Lambda, DynamoDB and API Gateway to allow users to post and view comments. I used CodePipeline to build the Jekyll site by processing files from CodeCommit and producing artefacts in the S3 bucket. I reduced the build time from 3 minutes to 30 seconds with a custom build environment by creating an image with pre-packaged dependencies</li>
