I"Ö<p>Iâ€™m on a quest to find cost-effective ways to store my data. The offerings from cloud providers are enticing, but the subscription payment method can cost a lot over time. Pre-built NAS boxes another option, but they come with a high upfront cost. I decided to create a storage solution using a Raspberry Pi 4 and an SSD drive. In this post, learn how to store data in a centralised location within a local area network and access that data from other devices.</p>
