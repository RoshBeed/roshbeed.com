AWS re/Start is a training and job placement programme, launched by Amazon Web Services, for the UK to educate young adults as well as military veterans, reservists, and their spouses, on the latest software development and cloud computing technologies.
  - Deployed a serverless website (www.roshbeed.com). I used CloudFront, Route 53 and S3 to serve the static assets. I created a microservice using Lambda, DynamoDB and API Gateway to allow users to post and view comments. I used CodePipeline to build the Jekyll site by processing files from CodeCommit and producing artefacts in the S3 bucket. I reduced the build time from 3 minutes to 30 seconds with a custom build environment by creating an image with pre-packaged dependencies
