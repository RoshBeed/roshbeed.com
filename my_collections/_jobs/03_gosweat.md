  - Set up Continuous Deployment with Bitbucket Pipelines to Google App Engine.
  - Presented demos on tools (e.g. Git and Docker) and how they could be used more efficiently to increase productivity.
  - Built trust with C-level executives and discussed strategies for long-term results.
  - Acted as Tech Lead during handover and led a team of 5 to create a knowledge-sharing platform for customers. I developed people into a high performing team and found ideas for the platform by speaking to customers.
